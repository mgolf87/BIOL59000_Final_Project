# BIOL59000_Final_Project
Repository for the A and B domain sequence data used in my BIOL59000 final project, as well as some code for finding the chromosome and domain sizes

#### B59_C6_ADomSeq and B59_C6_BDomSeq
Text files formated in fasta via >hur_chr6_484_+ where "hur" = Human Reference Genome; "chr6" = Chromosome 6; 
"484" = Bead 484 or Genomic Position 24,150,000 to 24,200,000; "+" = Forward Strand

#### chr6A_beads and chr6B_beads
Text files of the continuous domain ranges of either A or B domains where each number is a bead and each bead is 50 kb

#### MGolf_BIOL59000_DomainFilter
Code to find chromosome sizes from MEGABASE bead text files as well as domain sizes and conversion from kb into Mb
